These steps are currently working for Ubuntu 18.04. Other OS Support coming later.

1. run `./install.sh` # this will take up to 15-30 minutes pending your system's specs
2. run `./config.sh` # this setups the configuration and runs the node as a service on your Ubuntu system

# Notes
* allow port `30333` through your firewall. This is the default p2p port for node comms
